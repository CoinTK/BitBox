# Description

BitBox APP is an iOS App integrated with the [BitBox-Server](https://github.com/CoinTK/BitBox-Server) and [CoinTK](https://github.com/CoinTK/CoinTK) python scripts with fancy visualization tools.

BitBox keeps humans in the loop by providing them with the analysis and visualizations they need to make informed decisions about the trading algorithms they use.

The app is functional and should compile on most systems without issues.
