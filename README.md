# Description

BitBox App is an iOS App integrated with the [BitBox-Server](https://github.com/CoinTK/BitBox-Server) and [CoinTK](https://github.com/CoinTK/CoinTK) python scripts with fancy visualization tools.

The App is fully functional and should compile on most systems without issues. The web server (BitBox-Server) must be running in order to visualize each strategy.


BitBox keeps humans in the loop by providing them with the analysis and visualizations they need to make informed decisions about the trading algorithms they use.
