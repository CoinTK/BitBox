# Contibuting to Bitbox

Welcome to the Bitbox contributing page! We're super excited you've taken an interest in this project. See also, part of the CoinTK Initiative: [BitBox-Server](https://github.com/CoinTK/BitBox-Server), a webserver built on CoinTK for backtesting and dry running prototype strategies (remote control coming soon!).

[CoinTK](https://github.com/CoinTK/CoinTK), an open-sourced framework for rapid prototyping and testing of Bitcoin trading strategies. This is the foundation for everything.


## Quickstart
* Take a look at our [todo list](https://github.com/CoinTK/BitBox/blob/master/TODO.md)
* Browse through (and shoot down) some [bugs](https://github.com/CoinTK/BitBox/issues)
* Shoot an email to `agajews@gmail.com` to get added to the cointk.slack.com channel

## Testing
TBD

## Development environment details
Make sure you're running Python 3.3+, as some of the dynamic module loading requires relatively new features.
